Adversary Emulation
APTSimulator - Windows Batch script that uses a set of tools and output files to make a system look as if it was compromised.
Atomic Red Team (ART) - Small and highly portable detection tests mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework.
AutoTTP - Automated Tactics Techniques & Procedures. Re-running complex sequences manually for regression tests, product evaluations, generate data for researchers.
Blue Team Training Toolkit (BT3) - Software for defensive security training, which will bring your network analysis training sessions, incident response drills and red team engagements to a new level.
Caldera - Automated adversary emulation system that performs post-compromise adversarial behavior within Windows Enterprise networks. It generates plans during operation using a planning system and a pre-configured adversary model based on the Adversarial Tactics, Techniques & Common Knowledge (ATT&CKâ„¢) project.
DumpsterFire - Modular, menu-driven, cross-platform tool for building repeatable, time-delayed, distributed security events. Easily create custom event chains for Blue Team drills and sensor / alert mapping. Red Teams can create decoy incidents, distractions, and lures to support and scale their operations.
Metta - Information security preparedness tool to do adversarial simulation.
Network Flight Simulator - Lightweight utility used to generate malicious network traffic and help security teams to evaluate security controls and network visibility.
Red Team Automation (RTA) - RTA provides a framework of scripts designed to allow blue teams to test their detection capabilities against malicious tradecraft, modeled after MITRE ATT&CK.
RedHunt-OS - Virtual machine for adversary emulation and threat hunting.
